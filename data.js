    When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. It's all a game of angles.
    
    These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. You can do it. Only eight colors that you need. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.
    
    Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Get tough with it, get strong.
    
    Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
    
    Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.
    
    Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Zip. That easy. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And just raise cain. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.`,

    body: `So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. There it is. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

    If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Let all these things just sort of happen. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
    
    Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. You can spend all day playing with mountains.
    
    A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Every time you practice, you learn more.
    
    Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let's build an almighty mountain.`,

    body: `Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Son of a gun. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.
    
    You need the dark in order to show the light. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
    
    The least little bit can do so much. Working it up and down, back and forth. In your world you can create anything you desire. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
    
    Get tough with it, get strong. Happy painting, God bless. And maybe a little bush lives there.
    
    Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.`,

    You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.
    
    Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Just beat the devil out of it.`,
